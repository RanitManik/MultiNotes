# Code of Conduct for lucide note

lucide note is an open source project maintained by RanitManik. We want contributors, users, and community members to feel safe and welcome. This Code of Conduct explains our expectations for participant behavior and the steps maintainers will take to address unacceptable behavior.

## Our Standards

We expect everyone participating in project spaces to be respectful, collaborative, and constructive. Positive behaviors include:

- Showing empathy and kindness
- Listening and engaging with differing viewpoints respectfully
- Offering and accepting constructive feedback
- Acknowledging mistakes and learning from them

Behaviors that are not acceptable include, but are not limited to:

- Harassment, threats, or hate speech targeting any protected class
- Personal insults, public shaming, or doxxing
- Sharing private information without consent
- Sexualized language or imagery in project spaces
- Any conduct that creates a hostile environment for contributors or users

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it so we can address it promptly and fairly. Preferred reporting channels:

- Open an issue in this repository and tag @RanitManik (use the appropriate issue template and mark the issue confidential if needed)
  -- Email the project owner at <ranitmanik@users.noreply.github.com> (placeholder address â€” replace with a direct contact if you want email reports sent elsewhere)

Reports will be handled with discretion. Maintainers may follow up with the reporter for additional information.

## Enforcement

Maintainers will determine appropriate responses to misconduct, which may include:

- A private warning
- Removal of offending content
- Temporary or permanent exclusion from project communication channels or contribution access

When possible, maintainers will aim for consistency and transparency in enforcement while protecting reporters' privacy.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, chat channels, in-person events when representing lucide note, etc.).
